4.2.8 Exercises - Nmap


#1. ping sweep my target range
nmap -v -sn 10.11.1.1-254 -oG 4.2.8-1-exercise

#1. grep and save the ip addresses
grep Up 4.2.6-firstexercise | cut -d' ' -f2 > hostsup.txt

#2. scan the found ip addresses for web ports and os versions
for ip in $(cat hostsup.txt); do nmap -A -p 80,443 $ip; done


#3. perform smb os disc scan on all enumerated servers
for ip in $(cat hostsup.txt); do nmap $ip --script smb-os-discovery.nse; done

#4. Exploration exercise, not very easy to show. But I like -iL option *(read from file), -A and -O options. And the immense traffic of nmap is not only a network concern, but also a time concern since standalone nmap is serial, not parallel.
